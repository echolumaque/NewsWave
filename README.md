## Room for Improvement
- Better Error Handling: Show a user-friendly message if the network fails.

- Testing & Mocks: Expand unit test coverage, especially around network failures or decoding edge cases.
- Loading animations: Show a loading indicator as network calls may take some time to arrive.
